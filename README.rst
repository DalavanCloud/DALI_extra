* make sure that you really need to add additional data and no exiting can be used
* when adding it make sure that:
    * No personal information sufficient to identify a person (e.g., face, license plates)
    * No prominent logo usage (e.g., a picture of traffic that happens to include a Coke truck is okay, a picture solely of a Coke billboard is not)
